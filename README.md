# **Building your First NLP Architecture Using TensorFlow**

Since I entered in the data science world,  a word that always appeared when I was reading something related to coding deep learning applications was TensorFlow. I am a very visual person, and my curiosity is easily piqued by appealing brand names that promises great applications, so TensorFlow sparked my curiosity to explore its potential since the first time I put my eyes on it,  driving me to develop something just to experience its capabilities.Â  TensorFlow makes it easy to create ML models that can run in any environment. 

In this post I want to give you a short introduction about TensorFlow, and then we gonna build a simple neural network using it. The notebook will be available on my GitHub, but in Brazilian Portuguese. 

But, what is TensorFlow, exactly? If you havenâ€™t encountered it on your data path yet, I will give you a short explanation. 

## What is TensorFlow? An introduction

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning platform widely used by data scientists, developers, and educators. It uses data flow graphs to represent operations (nodes) and the tensors (edges) that pass between them. Its flexible architecture supports training and execution on GPUs, CPUs, and TPUs across devices and platforms without code changes. Initially developed by Google's Brain Team for deep neural network research, TensorFlow is versatile and applicable across various domains, enabling collaboration and boosting efficiency. [1]

### **Benefits of TensorFlow**

TensorFlow supports tasks like natural language processing, image and handwriting recognition, and computational simulations. Its key benefits include efficient execution on acceleration platforms, automatic gradient computation, scalability, and interoperable graph exportation. With Keras as a high-level API and eager execution for easier coding, TensorFlow ensures user-friendly development. Backed by Google, its rapid growth is further supported by an online [hub](https://www.tensorflow.org) for sharing user-created models. [1]


### Coding Part
You can check the coding and more detailed explanations in the notebook attached. Right now, the Notebook is available in Brazilian Portuguese, BUT you can find the same explanations in English [here](https://medium.com/@lorenamelo.engr/building-your-first-nlp-architecture-using-tensorflow-cd34683256a1) on my Medium.

**Check the following diagram to get an overview on what content you will see on the notebook ðŸ‘‡ **
